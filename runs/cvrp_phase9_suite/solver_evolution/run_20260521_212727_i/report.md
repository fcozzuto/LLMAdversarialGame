## Judge Note
### Conservative Summary of Phase-9 CVRP Solver-Evolution Suite

| Aspect                 | Evolved Solver                  | Baselines (Selected)                                    |
|------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| **Feasibility**        | 100% on held-out conditions    | 100% for all baselines                                  |
| **Held-out Objective Gap** | 0.273435 (same as Nearest Neighbor) | Clarke-Wright Savings: best gap 0.073766; Regret Insertion: worse (0.466391) |
| **Runtime (ms)**       | 137.18                         | Nearest Neighbor: 43.28; Clarke-Wright: 78.47; Regret Insertion: 1492.2 |
| **Robustness (dispersion)** | 0.002777 (low, same as Nearest Neighbor) | Clarke-Wright: 0.007791; Regret Insertion: 0.086899 (higher variability) |
| **Novelty/Complexity** | Zero novelty and complexity    | Zero for all baselines                                  |
| **Training Feasibility & Gap** | 100%, gap 0.337704        | Matched across baselines                                |

### Interpretation
- The evolved solver matches the feasibility and objective gap performance of the nearest neighbor constructive baseline but **does not improve upon the best baseline (Clarke-Wright Savings)** in terms of held-out objective gap.
- Runtime for the evolved solver is higher than nearest neighbor and Clarke-Wright but much less than regret insertion.
- Robustness is comparable and low dispersion similar to nearest neighbor.
- No significant novel solver behavior or complexity was introduced.
- Overall, the evolved solver **does not clearly beat fixed baselines**, especially the Clarke-Wright Savings baseline, which shows the lowest objective gap and competitive runtime.

---

**Conclusion:** The phase-9 evolved CVRP solver is feasible and robust but does not outperform the best fixed baseline (Clarke-Wright Savings) in objective gap or runtime on held-out structural families.
